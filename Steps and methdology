Loaded Dataset: Imported Bitext Customer Support CSV with instruction and response columns.
Selected 1000 Rows: Randomly sampled 1000 rows for faster training using df.sample(n=1000).
Cleaned Data: Removed NaN, non-string, and empty values from instruction and response.
Tokenized Data: Used GPT2Tokenizer to convert text to input_ids and attention_mask.
Converted to Tensors: Manually mapped dataset to PyTorch tensors to avoid ValueError.
Loaded Model: Initialized GPT2LMHeadModel with distilgpt2 weights.
Set Training Parameters: Configured 3 epochs, batch size 4, and saved every 500 steps.
Trained Model: Fine-tuned model on 1000 rows for fashion chatbot responses.
Saved Model: Saved trained model and tokenizer to /content/drive/MyDrive/fashion_bot_model.
Tested Model: Tested with questions like "Can I cancel my order?" and got relevant responses.
Created Pie Charts: Visualized category and intent distributions using Plotly.
Zipped Model: Zipped model folder for download with !zip -r fashion_bot_model.zip.
Resolved Errors: Fixed ValueError, FileExistsError, and runtime disconnect issues.
Checked Drive: Verified model files in Drive using os.listdir() to ensure saving.
Prepared for Internship: Collected responses for presentation to showcase chatbot performance.
